## Functionality Overview

This route assigns a Meta page to an assistant by verifying its details and making necessary API calls.

### 1. Extracting Data:

- **User Information**: The `clientId` is extracted from `req.user` or `req.body`.
- **Request Body**: The `assistantId` and `pageId` are extracted from `req.body`.

### 2. Page Validation:

- **Validation of Parameters**: If either `assistantId` or `pageId` is missing, it throws a `CustomError` with the message `"Invalid Parameters"`.
- **Check if Page is Already Assigned**: It retrieves the page details using `findMetaPage`. If the page is already assigned, it throws an error.
- **Business Ownership**: It checks if the page is associated with a business. If not, it throws an error.

### 3. Fetching Page Data:

- **Existing Data for the Page**: If the page is found in the database, the page's meta data is retrieved. If it’s assigned to a business, it fetches the `fbUserToken` for the assistant from the database.
- **Fetch Data from Meta**: If the page is not found in the database, it proceeds to fetch page data from Facebook’s API using the `graphApiAxiosInstance`. The request is made to fetch page details including business info, welcome messages, and category.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/${pageId}?access_token=${fbUserToken}&fields=${pageFields}&locale=en_US"
```

- Where `pageFields` are these:

```
 access_token,has_whatsapp_business_number,has_whatsapp_number,whatsapp_number,name,id,business,is_published,picture,messenger_ads_default_page_welcome_message{page_welcome_message_type,page_welcome_message_body},messenger_ads_default_icebreakers,category,connected_instagram_account
```

### 4. Error Handling for Meta Data:

- If there is an issue fetching the page from the Meta API (e.g., it’s not owned by any business), it throws a `CustomError`.
- If the business does not own the page, or if there are issues in the API response (like missing `business.id`), an error is thrown.

### 5. Preparing the New Page Data:

- **Meta Business ID and Name**: Extracted from the fetched Facebook page data.
- **Welcome Message**: If the welcome message is in JSON format, it's parsed and the ice breakers are extracted.
- **Picture URL**: The page picture URL is uploaded to S3 using the `uploadAndGetS3MediaUrl` function and the s3 url is then used in the `newPageData` object.

The `newPageData` object is then created to hold the data related to the page, such as:

- `clientId`
- `assistantId`
- `metaBusinessId`
- `metaBusinessName`
- `pageId`
- `pageName`
- `pageAccessToken`
- `whatsappNumber`
- `isPublished`
- `adsDefaultIcebreakers`
- `picture`
- `category`

### 6. Verifying Permissions:

- It checks if the assistant has the required permissions for the business associated with the page using `findMetaPage`. If no permissions are found, it throws a `CustomError`.

### 7. Assigning the Page:

- The `graphApiAxiosInstance` is used again to make an API call to Meta to assign the page to the assistant. The request is made with the `systemUserId` and `fbUserToken` to ensure the assistant has the correct permissions.

```sh
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/${pageId}/assigned_users" \
  -d "user=${systemUserId}" \
  -d "tasks=MANAGE" \
  -d "access_token=${fbUserToken}"
```

- If the assignment fails, an error is thrown.

### 8. Upsert Page Data:

- After successfully assigning the page, the `newPageData` is inserted or updated in the database using `upsertMetaPage`.

### 9. Response:

- If the operation is successful, it responds with the updated page data in the response body.
- In case of errors, the handler logs the error, processes any specific Meta API errors, and sends an appropriate error message in the response.
