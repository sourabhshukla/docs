## Functionality Overview

This route assigns a Meta Ad Account to an assistant by verifying its details and making necessary API calls.

### 1. Extracting Data:

- **User Information**: The `clientId` is extracted from `req.user` or `req.body`.
- **Request Body**: The `assistantId` and `adAccountId` are extracted from `req.body`.

### 2. Ad Account Validation:

- **Validation of Parameters**: If either `assistantId` or `adAccountId` is missing, it throws a `CustomError` with the message "Invalid Parameters".
- **Check if Ad Account is Already Assigned**: It retrieves the account details using `findOneMetaAdAccount`. If the account is already assigned, it throws an error.
- **Business Ownership**: It checks if the ad account is associated with a business. If not, it throws an error.

### 3. Fetching Ad Account Data:

- **Existing Data for the Ad Account**: If the account is found in the database, the account's meta data is retrieved. If it’s assigned to a business, it fetches the `fbUserToken` for the assistant from the database.
- **Fetch Data from Meta**: If the account is not found in the database, it proceeds to fetch account data from Facebook’s API using the `graphApiAxiosInstance`. The request is made to fetch account details including business info, balance, and status.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/${adAccountId}?access_token=${fbUserToken}&fields=id,name,business,user_tasks,account_status,amount_spent,balance,created_time,currency,is_prepay_account,min_campaign_group_spend_cap,min_daily_budget,timezone_name,age,disable_reason,funding_source,owner"
```

### 4. Error Handling for Meta Data:

- If there is an issue fetching the account from the Meta API (e.g., it’s not owned by any business), it throws a `CustomError`.
- If the business does not own the account, or if there are issues in the API response (like missing `business.id`), an error is thrown.

### 5. Preparing the New Ad Account Data:

- **Meta Business ID and Name**: Extracted from the fetched Facebook account data.
- **Funding Source Details**: The funding source ID is extracted if present.
- **Account Age Calculation**: The account age is calculated in years.

The `newAdAccountData` object is then created to hold the data related to the ad account, such as:

- `clientId`
- `assistantId`
- `metaBusinessId`
- `metaBusinessName`
- `accountId`
- `accountName`
- `accountStatus`
- `amountSpent`
- `tasks`
- `balance`
- `currency`
- `isPrepayAccount`
- `minAdSpend`
- `minDailyBudget`
- `fundingSource`
- `disableReason`
- `accountAge`
- `isAssigned`
- `status`
- `owner`
- `timezone`
- `accountCreatedAt`

### 6. Verifying Permissions:

- It checks if the assistant has the required permissions for the business associated with the ad account using `findMetaPage`. If no permissions are found, it throws a `CustomError`.

### 7. Assigning the Ad Account:

- The `graphApiAxiosInstance` is used again to make an API call to Meta to assign the ad account to the assistant. The request is made with the `systemUserId` and `fbUserToken` to ensure the assistant has the correct permissions.

```sh
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/${adAccountId}/assigned_users" \
  -d "user=${systemUserId}" \
  -d "tasks=MANAGE" \
  -d "access_token=${fbUserToken}"
```

- If the assignment fails, an error is thrown.

### 8. Upsert Ad Account Data:

- After successfully assigning the ad account, the `newAdAccountData` is inserted or updated in the database using `upsertAdAccount`.

### 9. Response:

- If the operation is successful, it responds with the updated ad account data in the response body.
- In case of errors, the handler logs the error, processes any specific Meta API errors, and sends an appropriate error message in the response.
