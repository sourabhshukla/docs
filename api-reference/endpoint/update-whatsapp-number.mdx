title: "Update Whatsapp Number"
openapi: "POST /meta-ads/update-whatsapp-number"
---

## Functionality Overview

Used to update the whatsapp number in the ads manager.

1. Extract `assistantId, number, pageId, verificationCode` from `req.body`.

2. Fetch the page details from DB using `assisatantId` and `pageId`.

   - Check if the number received in `req.body` is equal to `whatsappNumber` received from page detail from DB, If they are same then send a response to user stating that `the whatsapp number is already linked` and the `pageData` fetched from DB.

3. Else call this api:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{pageId}/page_whatsapp_number_verification" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "whatsapp_number": "{number}",
           "verification_code": "{verificationCode}",
           "access_token": "{pageAccessToken}",
           "locale": "en_US"
         }'

```

- If any error occurs in this api call then extract `error_subcode, code, message` from the `error` object and check if this condtion is satisfied

```javscript
   if (
        ([463, 467, 466, 460].includes(error_subcode) && code === 190) ||
        errMsg.includes(message)
      )
```

- If not satisfied then throw the error otherwise make this api call to fetch all pages from meta and find the current page using the `pageId` received in `req.body`.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{metaBusinessId}/owned_pages?access_token={systemUserToken}&fields=whatsapp_number,access_token&locale=en_US"
```

- If the page is not found then throw an error stating `Permissions missing`, otherwise get the `pageAccessToken` from the pageData fetched from meta and again make this api call and get the `otpResponse` from it and updated the `pageAccessToken` in the DB also.

```sh
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{pageId}/page_whatsapp_number_verification" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "whatsapp_number": "{number}",
           "verification_code": "{verificationCode}",
           "access_token": "{pageAccessToken}",
           "locale": "en_US"
         }'
```

4. Extract `verfication_status` from the `otpResponse` we got earlier. Now:
   - If `verfication_status` is `INVALID_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` then throw an error stating that the `Number is not linked with whatsapp`.
   - If `verfication_status` is `INVALID_VERIFICATION_CODE` then throw an error stating that the `OTP is invalid`.
   - If `verfication_status` is `VERIFICATION_CODE_SEND_SUCCESS` then send response stating that otp has been sent.
   - If `verfication_status` is either of these 2 values `VERIFIED, AUTO_VERIFIED_ENTERPRISE_NUMBER_DIRECT` then update the number in page Data in DB and send response to user stating that the otp verification was successfull.
   - If none of the conditions apply then we thrown an error stating `Invalid Data, Contact Admin`.
