title: "Fb Disconnect"
openapi: "POST /meta-ads/fb-disconnect"
---

## Functionality Overview

1. **Retrieve Assistant Data**
   - The system fetches the assistant details using `findOneLeanAssistant`.
   - It specifically checks the `fbConnectedBy` field to determine which user connected Facebook.
2. **Validate User Permissions**

   - If the user attempting the disconnection does not have sufficient privileges (`power !== 2`), they are restricted.
   - If the `fbConnectedBy` field exists and does not match the current user, access is denied.

3. **Fetch and Remove Meta Ad Accounts**

   - The system queries all Meta ad accounts linked to the assistant using `findMetaAdAccounts`.
   - If there are assigned ad accounts, they are grouped by `metaBusinessId`.
   - For each `metaBusinessId`, an API request is sent to Facebook Graph API to remove the business relationship using the following cURL request:
     ```sh
     curl -X DELETE "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{AISENSY_BM_ID}/managed_businesses?existing_client_business_id={CLIENT_BM_ID}&access_token={USERS_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
     ```
   - Any errors encountered during this API request are logged.

4. **Update Database Records**
   - The status of all ad accounts linked to the assistant is updated using `updateAllAdAccounts`.
   - The following fields are updated:
     - `status: "deleted"`
     - `isAssigned: false`
     - `systemUserToken: ""`
   - - The status of all linked Meta pages associated with the assistant is updated using `updateAllMetaPages`.

- The following fields are updated:
  - `status: "deleted"`
  - `isAssigned: false`
  - `systemUserToken: ""`. Each page is marked as `deleted`, set to unassigned, and its `systemUserToken` is cleared. This ensures that the pages can no longer be managed or accessed via the assistant's credentials, fully revoking their connection to the platform.

5. **Update Assistant Information**

   - The assistant’s details are modified using `updateAssistantReturnNew`.
   - The following fields are reset to remove Facebook-related information:
     - `fbConnected: false`
     - `fbConnectedBy: ""`
     - `selectedMetaPageId: ""`
     - `selectedMetaAdAccountId: ""`
     - `fbGrantedScopes: ""`
     - `freezedMetaAdAccountId: ""`
     - `freezedMetaPageId: ""`
     - `adSetupDetails.isSetupCompleted: false`

6. **Remove Facebook Permissions**

   - Calls `removeFbPermissions` to revoke all granted permissions for the Facebook user (`fbUserId`) and partner (`partnerId`).
   - The function iterates through a list of permission scopes and makes DELETE requests to revoke each permission individually using the following cURL request:
     ```sh
     curl -X DELETE "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{fbUserId}/permissions/{permission}?access_token={access_token}&locale=en_US"
     ```
   - If the API request is successful, it records the removed permission; otherwise, it logs the error message.

7. **Send Event Data**
   - Sends disconnection event logs to LSQ using `sendDataToLSQLeadOnEvent`.
   - The event payload includes:
     - `{ Attribute: "mx_Meta_Ads", Value: "Facebook disconnected" }`
   - A separate event is also logged to LSQ’s product event system using `sendDataToLSQProductOnEvent`, with the schema:
     - `{ SchemaName: "mx_Custom_80", Value: "Facebook disconnected" }`
