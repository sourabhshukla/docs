## Functionality Overview

Used to Link Whatsapp Number with the Page.

1. Extract `clientId, prospectId` from `req.user` and `assistantId, number, pageId, verificationCode , timezoneId, vertical, bmName, createBM` from `req.body` and call `verifyOtpForWaNumberLinkingToPage` function. Here is it's flow

- It takes `assisatantId,number,pageId,verificationCode` as parameters.
- Fetch the page details from DB using `assisatantId` and `pageId`.

  - Check if the number received in `req.body` is equal to `whatsappNumber` received from page detail from DB, If they are same then send a response to user stating that `the whatsapp number is already linked` and the `pageData` fetched from DB.

- Else call this api, note that `verification_code` here is only passed in this request if it is non-empty and get the otpResponse.

```sh
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{pageId}/page_whatsapp_number_verification" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "whatsapp_number": "{number}",
           "verification_code": "{verificationCode}",
           "access_token": "{pageAccessToken}",
           "locale": "en_US"
         }'

```

- If any error happens during the above api call and `verification_code` is non-empty then call `verifyOtpForWaNumberLinkingToPage` again but with `verification_code` set as empty string, but if the `verification_code` was an empty string then simply return error object from the function.

- If we get a successfull `otpResponse` then extract `verification_status`, and `error_message` from the otpResponse.
  - If `verfication_status` is `INVALID_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` then throw an error stating that the `Number is not linked with whatsapp`.
  - If `verfication_status` is `INVALID_VERIFICATION_CODE` then throw an error stating that the `OTP is invalid`.
  - If `verfication_status` is `VERIFICATION_CODE_SEND_SUCCESS` then send response stating that otp has been sent.
  - If `verification_status` is `BUSINESS_REQUEST_SEND_SUCCESS` then send response stating `Business request set successfully`.
  - If `verification_status` is `BUSINESS_REQUEST_SEND_FAILURE` then send response stating `Business request send failure`.
  - If `verfication_status` is either of these 2 values `VERIFIED, AUTO_VERIFIED_ENTERPRISE_NUMBER_DIRECT` then update the number in page Data in DB and send response to user stating that the otp verification was successfull.
  - If none of the conditions apply then we return an error stating `Invalid Data, Contact Admin`.

2. If any type of error is returned from `verifyOtpForWaNumberLinkingTwoPage` then send failure message notification on slack along with the error object and throw the error.

3. If there was no error then get the `otpState` from the response we received from the `verifyOtpForWaNumberLinkingTwoPage` and check if it is equal to `'verified'`

- If the otp is verified then we check if the user has already claimed free credits or not.
  - If user has not claimed the free credits then we add the free credits to his account, update the `adSetupDetails` object in the assistant and two jobs are added to Queue.
  - otherwise we just update the `adSetupDetails` object in the assistant.

4.  Fetch assistant details from DB.

5.  if the otp is not verified or `createBM` received from request in false then simply send the response gotten from `verifyOtpForWaNumberLinkingToPage` function.

6.  Call the `setupTwoTierAdAccount` method, here is the flow:

    - This function takes these arguments `assistant, assistantId, clientId, vertical, pageId, timezoneId, childBusinessName`
    - Fetch a `MetaAdsTwoTier` document by using `{userId: assistant.fbUserId}`
      -- If these is a document present for the `fbUserId` then check if the `assisatantId` from the two tier document matches the `assisatantId` passed to the function. If both are different then throw and error `This FB account is already linked with another project. For more query please contact support`.
      -- But if both assistantId's are same then fetch the ad account details from the DB using the `assisatantId` and businessId from the two tier account. and return the ad account and two tier account details.

    - Now if there is no two tier account present then, we fetch assistant details from DB if not already present.
    - Create a new Child Business Manager using this meta api, where `childBusinessName` is `New Ai Aisensy Ads Business Manager`;
