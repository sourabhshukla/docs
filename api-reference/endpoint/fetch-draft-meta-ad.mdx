## Functionality Overview

This route retrieves draft Meta Ads for a given assistant within a specified ad account.

### 1. Extracting Data:

- **User Information**: The `clientId` is extracted from `req.user`.
- **Request Body**: The following fields are extracted from `req.body`:
  - `assistantId`: ID of the assistant.
  - `adId`: (Optional) MongoDB ID of the specific draft ad to retrieve.

### 2. Fetching Draft Ad:

- **Single Draft Ad**:

  - If `adId` is provided, the route calls `MetaAdDraftDb.findMetaAdDraft` with the query:
    - `{ _id: adId, assistantId, clientId }`
  - Returns the corresponding draft ad from DB if found.

- **All Draft Ads**:
  - If `adId` is not provided, the route calls `MetaAdDraftDb.findMetaAdDrafts` with the query:
    - `{ assistantId, clientId, adStatus: "DRAFT" }`
  - Returns all draft ads associated with the given assistant and client from DB.

### 3. Response:

- **Success**:
  - Returns the retrieved draft ad(s) with a `200` status code.
- **Failure**:
  - If an error occurs, responds with a `500` status code and the error message.

### Error Handling:

- If either database call fails, the caught error is sent in the response with a `500` status code.

### Notes:

- Ensure that `assistantId` and `clientId` are valid and correspond to existing records.
- When providing an `adId`, verify its format and existence in the database.
- The returned draft ads will have an `adStatus` of `DRAFT`.
