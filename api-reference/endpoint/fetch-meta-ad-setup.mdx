openapi: "POST /meta-ads/fetch-meta-ad-setup"
---

## Functionality Overview

This route retrieves the Meta Ad setup details for a given assistant by validating the access token and checking the setup status.

### 1. Extracting Data:

- **Request Body**: The `assistantId` is extracted from `req.body`.

### 2. Assistant Validation:

- **Check if Assistant Exists**: It retrieves the assistant's data using `findOneLeanAssistant`. If the assistant is not found or not connected to Facebook, an error is thrown.
- **Required Fields**: The response includes fields like `fbUserToken`, `fbUserId`, `fbConnected`, `adSetupDetails`, and `specialAccess`.

### 3. Fetching Meta Ads Two-Tier Data:

- It uses `findOneMetaAdsTwoTier` to retrieve data about child business managers associated with the assistant.
- If there is an error or no valid data, an exception is thrown.

### 4. Token Validation:

- The `fbUserToken` is verified using the `getTokenInfo` function.
- **Granular Scopes Check**: Iterates through `granularScopes` to ensure the token has the required permissions like `pages_show_list`, `pages_manage_metadata`, and `business_management`.
- **Target IDs Check**: Determines if the token has associated target IDs, indicating permission restrictions.
- **Explanation of getTokenInfo**:
  - **URL Construction**: Constructs the URL for the Facebook Graph API to debug the token.
  - **API Call**: Sends a GET request to the endpoint `/debug_token` with the input token and the system user access token.
  - **Data Extraction**: Extracts `scopes`, `granular_scopes`, `issued_at`, `is_valid`, and `data_access_expires_at`.
  - **Error Handling**: If any error occurs, it marks the token as invalid.

**Meta API Call**:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/debug_token?input_token=<INPUT_TOKEN>&access_token=<SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>&locale=en_US"
```

### 5. Setup Completion Check:

- It checks if `fetchedChildBM` exists the `userId` field in it and matches the `fbUserId` field in the assistant data.
- If the assistant has an associated Meta page with an active status and a valid `whatsappNumber`, the setup is marked as completed.

### 6. Updating Assistant Status:

- The assistant's `fbConnected` status is updated based on the token validity and presence of `fetchedChildBM`.
- The `adSetupDetails` field is updated to reflect whether the setup is completed.

### 7. Response:

- If the operation is successful, it responds with the following fields:
  - `pageId`: ID of the shared Meta page.
  - `adAccountId`: ID of the associated ad account.
  - `isValid`: Boolean indicating if the access token is valid.
  - `userId`: The user ID associated with the fetched business manager.

### 8. Error Handling:

- If an exception occurs at any stage, it logs the error and returns a `500` status code with the message "Something went wrong".

### Notes:

- Ensure that the `fbUserToken` has the necessary granular scopes for the operation.
- The Meta API responses are handled with care to prevent false positives in the `isSetupCompleted` status.
